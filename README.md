# hello-world
This is my first repository.  I am creating this repository as part of the getting started tutorial for Github.

Hi World!
My name is Emanuel and I was born in Guatemala.  I grew up in a small town in the highland of Guatemala and attendend a public elementary school.  Later, I was able to attend secondary school with a full scholarship and earned my associates degree in Forestry.  Since this experience in secondary school, I found maps very interesting and quickly I found a passion to learn more about the geography field.
